## Problem: You're working with an intern that keeps coming to you with JavaScript code that won't run because the braces, brackets, and parentheses are off. To save you both some time, you decide to write a braces/brackets/parentheses validator.

Let's say:

```
'(', '{', '[' are called "openers."
')', '}', ']' are called "closers."
```

Write an efficient function that tells us whether or not an input string's openers and closers are properly nested.

Examples:

```
"{ [ ] ( ) }" should return true
"{ [ ( ] ) }" should return false
"{ [ }" should return false
```

## Gotchas

Simply making sure each opener has a corresponding closer is not enoughâ€”we must also confirm that they are correctly ordered.

For example, `"{ [ ( ] ) }"` should return false, even though each opener can be matched to a closer.

We can do this in O(n) time and space. One iteration is all we need!

## Solution

We iterate through our string, making sure that:

1. each closer corresponds to the most recently seen, unclosed opener
2. every opener and closer is in a pair

We use a stack to keep track of the most recently seen, unclosed opener. And if the stack is ever empty when we come to a closer, we know that closer doesn't have an opener.

So as we iterate:

- If we see an opener, we push it onto the stack.
- If we see a closer, we check to see if it is the closer for the opener at the top of the stack. If it is, we pop from the stack. If it isn't, or if the stack is empty, we return false.

If we finish iterating and our stack is empty, we know every opener was properly closed.

```
const bracketValidator = function(string) {

  let openToClosed = {
    "(" : ")",
    "{" : "}",
    "[" : "]",
  }

  let openBrackets = new Set(["(", "{", "["]);
  let closedBrackets = new Set([")", "}", "]"]);

  let stack = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < string.length; i++){
    let char = string[i];

    if(openBrackets.has(char)){
      stack.push(char);
    } else if (closedBrackets.has(char)){
      if(!stack.length){
        return false;
      }

      let recentOpener = stack.pop(); // [

      if(openToClosed[recentOpener] !== char){
        return false;
      }
    }
  }
  return stack.length === 0;
}

const string = "{[]()}"
const anotherString = "{[(])}"
const anotherAnotherString = "{[}";

bracketValidator(anotherAnotherString)
```

## Complexity

O(n) time (one iteration through the string), and O(n) space (in the worst case, all of our characters are openers, so we push them all onto the stack).
