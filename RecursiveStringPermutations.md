## Problem: Write a recursive function for generating all permutations of an input string. Return them as a set.

Don't worry about time or space complexity—if we wanted efficiency we'd write an iterative version.

To start, assume every character in the input string is unique.

Your function can have loops—it just needs to also be recursive.

## Gotchas

Make sure you have a base case! Otherwise your function may never terminate!

## Breakdown

Let's break the problem into subproblems. How could we re-phrase the problem of getting all permutations for "cats" in terms of a smaller but similar subproblem?

Let's make our subproblem be getting all permutations for all characters except the last one. If we had all permutations for "cat," how could we use that to generate all permutations for "cats"?

We could put the "s" in each possible position for each possible permutation of "cat"!

These are our permutations of "cat":

```
cat
cta
atc
act
tac
tca
```

For each of them, we add "s" in each possible position. So for "cat":

```
  cat
    scat
    csat
    cast
    cats
```

And for "cta":

```
  cta
    scta
    csta
    ctsa
    ctas
```

And so on.

Now that we can break the problem into subproblems, we just need a base case and we have a recursive algorithm!

## Solution

If we're making all permutations for "cat," we take all permutations for "ca" and then put "t" in each possible position in each of those permutations. We use this approach recursively:

```
  function getPermutations(string) {

  // Base case
  if (string.length <= 1) {
    return new Set([string]);
  }

  const allCharsExceptLast = string.slice(0, -1);
  const lastChar = string[string.length - 1];

  // Recursive call: get all possible permutations for all chars except last
  const permutationsOfAllCharsExceptLast = getPermutations(allCharsExceptLast);

  // Put the last char in all possible positions for each of the above permutations
  const permutations = new Set();

  permutationsOfAllCharsExceptLast.forEach(permutationOfAllCharsExceptLast => {
    for (let position = 0; position <= allCharsExceptLast.length; position++) {
      const permutation = permutationOfAllCharsExceptLast.slice(0, position) + lastChar + permutationOfAllCharsExceptLast.slice(position);
      
      permutations.add(permutation);
    }
  });

  // return permutations;
}

getPermutations('cat')
```
