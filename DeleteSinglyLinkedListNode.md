## Problem: Delete a node from a singly-linked list, given only a variable pointing to that node.

The input could, for example, be the variable b below:

```
  class LinkedListNode {
  constructor(value) {
    this.value = value;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

const a = new LinkedListNode('A');
const b = new LinkedListNode('B');
const c = new LinkedListNode('C');

a.next = b;
b.next = c;

deleteNode(b);
```

## Gotchas

We can do this in O(1) time and space! But our answer is tricky, and it could have some side effects...

## Breakdown

It might be tempting to try to traverse the list from the beginning until we encounter the node we want to delete. But in this situation, we don't know where the head of the list is—we only have a reference to the node we want to delete.

But hold on—how do we even delete a node from a linked list in general, when we do have a reference to the first node?

We'd change the previous node's pointer to skip the node we want to delete, so it just points straight to the node after it.

A singly-linked list with 3 nodes. The first node has value 1 and points to the second node, which has value 4 and points to the third node, which has value 0 and points to "None." We're trying to delete the second node.

Now, in the same linked list, the first node points to the third node. So the second node will be skipped and no arrows point to it.

So we need a way to skip over the current node and go straight to the next node. But we don't even have access to the previous node!

Other than rerouting the previous node's pointer, is there another way to skip from the previous pointer's value to the next pointer's value?

What if we modify the current node instead of deleting it?

## Solution

We take value and next from the input node's next node and copy them into the input node. Now the input node's previous node effectively skips the input node's old value!

A singly-linked list with 3 nodes. The first node has value 3 and points to the second node, which has value 8 and points to the third node, which has value 2 and points to "None." We're trying to delete the second node.

Now, in the same linked list, the second node has value 2 and points to "None." The second node matches the third node, and no arrows point to the third node.

In some languages, like C, we'd have to manually delete the node we copied from, since we won't be using that node anymore. Here, we'll let JavaScript's garbage collector take care of it.

```
  function deleteNode(nodeToDelete) {

  // Get the input node's next node, the one we want to skip to
  const nextNode = nodeToDelete.next;

  if (nextNode) {

    // Replace the input node's value and pointer with the next
    // node's value and pointer. The previous node now effectively
    // skips over the input node
    nodeToDelete.value = nextNode.value;
    nodeToDelete.next  = nextNode.next;

  } else {

    // Eep, we're trying to delete the last node!
    throw new Error("Can't delete the last node with this technique!");
  }
}
```

But be careful—there are some potential problems with this implementation:

**First, it doesn't work for deleting the ***last node*** in the list.** We could change the node we're deleting to have a value of null, but the second-to-last node's next pointer would still point to a node, even though it should be null. This could work—we could treat this last, "deleted" node with value null as a "dead node" or a "sentinel node," and adjust any node traversing code to stop traversing when it hits such a node. The trade-off there is we couldn't have non-dead nodes with values set to null. Instead we chose to throw an exception in this case.

Second, this technique can cause some unexpected side-effects. For example, let's say we call:

```
const a = new LinkedListNode(3);
const b = new LinkedListNode(8);
const c = new LinkedListNode(2);

a.next = b;
b.next = c;

deleteNode(b);
```

There are two potential side-effects:

1. **Any references to the input node have now effectively been reassigned to its next node.** In our example, we "deleted" the node assigned to the variable b, but in actuality we just gave it a new value (2) and a new next! If we had another pointer to b somewhere else in our code and we were assuming it still had its old value (8), that could cause bugs.
2. **If there are pointers to the input node's original next node, those pointers now point to a "dangling" node** (a node that's no longer reachable by walking down our list). In our example above, c is now dangling. If we changed c, we'd never encounter that new value by walking down our list from the head to the tail.
